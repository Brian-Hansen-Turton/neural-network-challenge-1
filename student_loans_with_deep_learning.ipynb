    "To build a recommendation system for student loan options, it is essential to collect data that directly impacts loan suitability and affordability. This includes demographic information like age, location, and educational level, which helps identify eligibility for specific loans. Loan preferences, such as interest rate type, repayment terms, and loan type, provide insights into the student's priorities. Academic details, including the institution, field of study, and expected graduation date, are crucial for matching loans aligned with their educational goals. Financial history, such as credit score, income level, existing debts, and payment history, is vital to determine eligibility and repayment capacity. Additionally, behavioral data, like past interactions with loan options or applications, allows the system to refine recommendations based on user patterns. Collecting this data ensures the system can make personalized and relevant recommendations tailored to each student's unique financial and academic circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.**\n",
    "The model would primarily use content-based filtering because the data collected is specific to individual students, including their preferences, financial history, and demographics. These features allow the system to recommend loans that closely match the characteristics and needs of the user. Collaborative filtering may not be ideal in this scenario because student loan needs can be highly individualized, and there may not be sufficient shared preferences among users to build recommendations effectively.\n",

    "Bias in Recommendations: If the training data contains biases (e.g., historical trends favoring certain demographics), the system may unintentionally propagate these biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory recommendations. Addressing fairness and ensuring equitable access is critical for building trust and compliance with regulations."
